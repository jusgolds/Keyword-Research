This app was built in order to analyze job descriptions for the most common words.

It is built with the Natural Language Processing Toolkit to tokenize each word,
remove any stop words and then store individual words in a database. 
Once words are added to the database, the app will tally any subsequent instances
of a word to help me understand the most common words in job descriptions for roles
that interest me.
